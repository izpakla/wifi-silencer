WiFi Silencer is a convenient and user-friendly Android app that allows you to customize your
phone's ringer settings based on the WiFi network you're connected to.

### Features

- Set specific ringer modes for different WiFi networks
- Set default ringer settings for when you are disconnected from WiFi or connected to an unknown
  network
- Automatically switch ringer settings based on connected WiFi network
- Easy to use interface for customization

With WiFi Silencer, you can easily set specific ringer modes for different WiFi networks, ensuring
that your phone is always set to the appropriate volume for your current location. For example, if
you want your phone to be silent at work, you can set your work WiFi to be silent in the app's
settings. When you arrive at work and connect to the WiFi network, your phone will automatically
switch to silent mode.

Similarly, if you want your phone to be loud at home, you can set your home WiFi to be in ringer
mode in the app's settings. This way, your phone will switch back to ringer mode as soon as you get
home, so you won't miss any important calls or notifications.

In addition to setting specific ringer modes for different WiFi networks, WiFi Silencer also allows
you to set default ringer settings that will be used when you are disconnected from WiFi or
connected to an unknown network. This ensures that you always have control over your phone's ringer
settings, no matter where you are.

So if you're tired of manually switching your phone's ringer settings every time you change
locations, give WiFi Silencer a try. It's a simple and effective way to ensure that your phone is
always set to the appropriate volume for your current surroundings.
